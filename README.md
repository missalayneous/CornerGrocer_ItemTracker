# CornerGrocer_ItemTracker

•	Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The “CornerGrocer” Item tracker is a program created to mirror an inventory type system. The program opens and saves a backup file of an inventory list of items in stock. You can then view the quantity of the items in several ways — by searching for a single item by name, printing a full list with quantities, or printing a histogram style list.

•	What did you do particularly well?
I am particularly proud of the way that I aligned the output for the Histogram style list. I coded it so that the Asterisks start at the same spot, so the full histogram effect is created. It took a bit of extra research, but it paid off in the end with a clean and pleasing output.

•	Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could enhance the program by separating the class definitions and implementations into header and source files respectively. This would make for a program that is more manageable and organized. Another change that might enhance the program is changing the way that the program accesses the data each time. Instead of reading the backup file, we could read it directly from the map for each method.

•	Which pieces of code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The most challenging pieces of this project for me related to thinking about how to access the inventory data between each function. I overcame this by doing a lot of reading about class hierarchies and modularization using multiple sources to compare definitions. 

•	What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Working with files is an incredibly useful skill to have when programming and will be useful to know in the future. Maintaining code in a clean and modular fashion is another skill that helps to your programs data and variables secure and organized. Building this skill is essential to being a successful programmer.

•	How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Using clear comments and breaking up the code makes this program more readable. Error handling and using meaningful variable names make the program more adaptable and maintainable.
